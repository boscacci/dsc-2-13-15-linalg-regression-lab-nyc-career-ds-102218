    "# Regression with Linear Algebra - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we shall apply regression analysis using simple matrix manipulations to fit a model to given data, and then predict new values for previously unseen data. We shall follow the approach highlighted in previous lesson where we used numpy to build the appropriate matrices and vectors and solve for the $\\beta$ (unknown variables) vector. The beta vector will be used with test data to make new predictions. We shall also evaluate how good our model fit was. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make this experiment interesting. We shall use NumPy at every single stage of this experiment i.e. loading data, creating matrices, performing test train split, model fitting and evaluations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use linear algebra to apply simple regression modeling in Python and NumPy only\n",
    "* Apply train/test split using permutations in NumPy\n",
    "* Use matrix algebra with inverses and dot products to calculate the beta\n",
    "* Make predictions from the fitted model using previously unseen input features \n",
    "* Evaluate the fitted model by calculating the error between real and predicted values\n"

    "## Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use for this experiment is \"**Sales Prices in the City of Windsor, Canada**\", something very similar to the Boston Housing dataset. This dataset contains a number of input (independent) variables, including area, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, facilities(AC/garage) etc. and an output (dependent) variable, **price**. We shall formulate a linear algebra problem to find linear mappings from input to out features using the equation provided in the previous lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow us to find a relationship between house features and house price for the given data, allowing us to find unknown prices for houses, given the input features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A description of dataset and included features is available at [THIS LINK](https://rdrr.io/cran/Ecdat/man/Housing.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "In your repo, the dataset is available as `windsor_housing.csv` containing following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "there are 11 input features (first 11 columns):\n",
    "\n",
    "\tlotsize\tbedrooms\tbathrms\tstories\tdriveway\trecroom\tfullbase\tgashw\tairco\tgaragepl\tprefarea\n",
    "\n",
    "and 1 output feature i.e. **price** (12th column). \n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this lab is not really answering a preset analytical question, but to learn how we can perform a regression experiment, similar to one we performed in statsmodels, using mathematical manipulations. So we we wont be using any Pandas or statsmodels goodness here. The key objectives here are to a) understand regression with matrix algebra, and b) Mastery in NumPy scientific computation. "
